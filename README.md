# Machine-Learning-Project

This project aims to use a dataset from kaggle.com based around League of Legends to see how well different machine learning algorithms could potentially predict wins. Also these algorithms can be used to show what are the most important features and some insight into how you may play the game. Also with this notebook is a non-technical presentation that goes a little more into how League is played and more about the game. However the basics of League are that it is the most popular MOBA game in the world with teams of 5 trying to destroy the other teams Nexus.

# Notes:
1. games.csv has all the data from the played games
2. champion_info.json has the names of all the champions and the number that represents them in games.csv
3. summoner_spell_info.json has the names of all the summoner spells used and the number that represents them in games.csv
4. In all columns that aren't champions or summoners, a 1 represents team1 and a 2 represents team2 respectively. A 0 represents that one of the teams forfeited before any objective was achieved by any team.
5. In the winners column, a 1 represents team1 and a 2 represents team2 winning respectively.
